# Interaction with Cores


## Communication With Cores 

> Researchers would benefit from an open-ended support option from Core facilities.

Core facilities are challenged to produce actionable results at a reasonable cost though clients of these facilities (Microbiome and Metabolomics in particular) may want follow-up support as they progress towards publishable conclusions. Faculty understand that they have a responsibility to acquire the requisite knowledge to speak intelligently about newer data types but will sometimes need help as they get up to speed. While most of those interviewed felt comfortable with Core results, some had yet to fully engage these services so could not comment on the experience whereas others wanted the option of more followup. One investigator, Donghai Liang, reports satisfaction with the Metabolomics core though points to his prior experience with this type of data during his PhD work. Non coincidentally, he is sometimes asked to assist with interpretation issues and, while he is willing to help, he is increasingly engaged with his new duties as a Research Professor. 

## Domain Expertise vs Remedial Knowledge

Cores generally do not have the personnel to provide ongoing support outside of the initial engagement. Core rates are generally transaction-based when what investigators sometimes desire is a consultation service that, depending on the effort involved, would involve a per-hour, "attorney" style engagement which might add considerably to the cost of Core use. When faced with this scenario investigators might seek to use their network to complete the work or hire their own resources. Obviously, the best situation occurs when there is a strong intersection of knowledge between the Core facility and the investigator. Both sides have the requisite background to ask pointed questions about software pipelines and the experimental techniques used in the process as well as some knowledge of the domain from which the data was generated.

The second case is where the investigator has some common knowledge with the Core yet still needs help working with the results or wishes to explore alternative scenarios that would then require facility with the pipelines used to generate the initial results. The Core might assume that the investigator already has such knowledge and might then view such requests as remedial especially if their point of intersection is a proxy for the investigator such as a student. So, satisfaction with the Core might then become a function of how willing it is to provide this level of support. One possible solution would be some reliance on the Data Science group mentioned in 1.3.4 though it depends on the nature of the question. If it relates to facility with languages and data reshaping or transformation then this might be useful though if it relates to expertise with the experimental data type then the Core remains the best source of information. In either case, the investigator must offer a motivated representative to work through these issues as neither group can take on these issues in whole unless of course they are being compensated specifically for that effort.
